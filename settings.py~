# lino_book.projects.min1 is a simple out-of-the-box project included with Lino.
# We import these directories into the local namespace with *.
 # The SITE = Site(globals(), title"My Lino site") turns my Django project into a Lino Project.
		# We instantiate a Site() class and store the object as SITE in Django settings.
		# This line automatically installs  default values for all required Django settings
		# ... such as DATABASES and LOGGING into the global namespace.

# So, Site has already been instantiated with all of its attributes in global namespace.
